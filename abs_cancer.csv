"Cancer disease has been reported as one of the deadliest genetic maladies of the human genome. It has been the research interest until today by doctors, pathologist, biologist and others life science and health professionals. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported cancer disease having 14 million new cases in 2012. This disease is a major cause or morbidity and mortality that accounts of death globaly resulting 8.8 million deaths in 2015 [1]. The World Cancer Report described cancer as a global problem and projected an increase to 20 million new cases by 2025 [2]. There are several research in cancer classification that used different techniques using gene analysis and classification. The important goal in cancer disease research is to identify the specific genes that caused normal cells to mutate into cancer disease. There are approaches in technology that reveals the cellular and molecular level of cancer. In a cancer disease sample such a cell biopsy to be processed, thousands of genes at a time can be subjected for analysis in a single chip called microarray. Microarrays are microscopic slides that contain ordered series of samples of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acids), RNA (Ribonucleic acids), protein, or tissue and others [3]. A single chip microarray can measure the gene expressions of 30,000 gene sample that represents most of the human genome [4]. The challenge of cancer classification using the microarray is the application of model based selection and prediction algorithm that will classify the cancer genes using gene expression data. The computation time, classification accuracy, and its biological relevance in the cancer classification was still in question.
